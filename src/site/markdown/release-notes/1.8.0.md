Apache Rampart 1.8.0 Release Note
---------------------------------

Apache Rampart 1.8.0 is a major release designed for compatibility with Axis2
1.8.2. 

A huge amount of effort went into upgrading everything possible up to jakarta - 
namely opensaml to 4.3 and ws-wss4j to 3.0.3.

This will be the last javax based release. The next Rampart release will be 2.0.0 
and will support Axis2 2.0.0, Jakarta, servlet 6.0 and EE 10. This should happen
soon as the hardwork in Axis2 2.0.0 has been done already.

The Apache Rampart and top level Axis project covering Axis2 needs committers! 

GitHub PR's are welcome too. If you have an interest in a feature that Rampart
lacks or simple a bug, please think about contributing.
