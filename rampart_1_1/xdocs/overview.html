<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the people involved in it. 
We invite you to participate as much or as little as you choose. The roles and 
responsibilities that people can assume in the project are based on merit. 
Everybody's input matters!</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to participate. Regardless of how you choose to 
participate, we suggest you join some or all of our <a href="mail-lists.html">
mailing lists</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Use the Products and Give Us Feedback</b> </h2>
<p>Using the products, reporting bugs, making feature requests, etc. is by far 
the most important role. It's your feedback that allows the technology to 
evolve. </p>
