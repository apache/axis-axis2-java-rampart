<h2>General</h2>
<ol>
<li><a name="a1"></a><strong>I'm having a problem using Axis2. What should I do?</strong><br>

    <p>First make sure you go through user guide and this FAQ. If you are using a released version of Axis2, then there is a possibility that your problem has already being fixed in the latest code. Download Axis2 nightly builds from <a href="http://ws.zones.apache.org/dist/axis2/nightly/">here</a> and test again with it. </p>
    <p>If the problem still persists then try to search for your question in our <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=axis-dev&r=1&w=2">developer</a> or <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=axis-user&r=1&w=2">user</a> mailing archives as it might have already being answered. </p>
   <p>If your problem is not answered in the mailing list, now it is the best time to post your question to axis-user mailing list. If you think it is a bug, please fill a bug report in <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS2">JIRA</a>. Please attach all the supportive information, like your wsdl, schema, clients, services, stacktraces, etc., to the JIRA issue you created, as it will help one of our contributors to re-create the problem. <b>PLEASE DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS USING JIRA AND USE IT ONLY AS A ISSUE TRACKER.</b> </p> 
    <p>If you are asking for an explanation of a feature in Axis2, there is a possibility that there is an article or FAQ written on it. Please do a search on the web as there are lot of article written and hosted by various sources on the web. </p>
    <p><b>Note</b> : When you ask questions in the mailing list, please remember that everyone working in our project are volunteers. No-one can be forced to fix your bugs (check <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html#what-is-apache-NOT-about">here</a>).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you add enough information about your problem with stacktraces and any other supportive information. It will improve the chances of your question being answered. Prefixing your mail subject with prefixes like "URGENT" will not help you in any means. Yes we also accept all the blames about Axis2 in these mailing lists, as those will definitely help us to improve Axis2 :) . </p>

  <li><a name="a3"></a><strong>Integration security tests fail with JDK
    1.5</strong><br>

    <p>You have to add Bouncy Castle as a JCE provider. Add the following
    entry to java.security file of the appropriate JRE on your machine. This
    file is available in the lib\security\ directory within the JRE
    directory.</p>
    <p>security.provider.7=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider</p>
    <p>security.provider.# will have to be decided depending on the existing
    entries in the java.security file</p>
    <p>NOTE: For Windows XP the correct version can be found using 'java
    -version'. The correct file is JRE (typically c:\Program
    Files\Java\jre&lt;version&gt;\lib\security\java.security.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Class Loading Issues</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a name="b1"></a><strong>How do I access resources that I put into my
    service /module archive file?</strong></li>

  <p>Axis2 has the notion of service isolation where each service or module
  gets its own class loader. Using this class loader you can access any
  resource that you put into your service archive file. You may want to
  access your resources from different locations. For example,</p>

  <p>1. A third party module wants to access your resources, then the
  scenario is as follows:</p>
  <pre>   AxisService myService =
   messageContext.getAxisConfiguration().getAxisService("serviceName"); </pre>

   <p>or</p>
<pre>
   AxisService myService = msgCtx.getAxisService();</pre>

  <p>Then you can ask for service class loader using which you can access its
  resources</p>
  <pre>   ClassLoader clsLoader = myService.getServiceClassLoader();
   clsLoader.getResourceAsStream("myResource");</pre>

  <p>2. To initialize service implementation class at the MessageReceiver
  level the following steps need to be taken</p>
  <pre>   AxisService service = msgCtx.getAxisService();
   ClassLoader clsLoader = service.getServiceClassLoader();
   Class.forName("serviceName",clsLoader,true);</pre>

  <p>NOTE : Axis2 default MessageReciver uses the same technique to
  initialize service implementations</p>

  <p>3. If you want to load your resources at the service implementation
  class then the scenario is as follows</p>
  <pre>   getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("myResource");</pre>
</ol>

<h2>Client API</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a name="c1"></a><strong>I want to do request response Messaging, Where
    should I look?</strong><br>

    <p>Look at the <a
    href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/webservices/axis2/trunk/java/modules/core/src/org/apache/axis2/client/ServiceClient.java"
    target="_blank">ServiceClient</a> class, for more information please read
    the <a href="1_1/userguide.html" target="_blank">User's Guide</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="c2"></a><strong>I want to do One Way Messaging, Where should I
    look?</strong><br>

    <p>From Axis2 0.94 onwards, both request-response and one way messaging
    will be handled by <a
    href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/webservices/axis2/trunk/java/modules/core/src/org/apache/axis2/client/ServiceClient.java"
    target="_blank">ServiceClient</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="c3"></a><strong>When I try to do a non blocking call with <pre>useSeparateListener=true</pre> I get the error <i>to do two Transport Channels
    the Addressing Modules must be engaged</i>, Why is this?</strong><br>

    <p>To do the two transport Channel invocation you need to engage the
    addressing module. You can enable it by un-commenting the entry in the
    axis2.xml file or Call.engageModule(QName). But addressing is enabled by
    default.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="c4"></a><strong>I have engaged addressing and when I was trying to
    invoke a service I am getting an exception </strong><br>

    <p>If you have engaged addressing , then you have to have wsa:action, the required WS-Addressing header. so you have to call  <br>
    option.setAction("urn:myaction"); <br>
    It should be not that the action should be a URI.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="c5"><strong>What is Axis2 Repository?</strong></a><br>

    <p>Repository stores the configuration of Axis2, the users should specify
    the repository folder starting the Axis Server (HTTP or TCP). In the case
    of tomcat it is the webapps/axis2/WEB-INF folder. Following picture shows
    a sample repository.</p>
    <img src="images/faq/1.jpg">
    <p>Modules and services have a archive format defined and they are
    automatically picked up by Axis2 when they are copied to corresponding
    folders.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Maven</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a name="d1"></a><strong>I just installed maven and it gives an error
    when I was trying to run maven on Axis2 ......</strong>
    <p>Axis2 requires itest plugin to run some of the tests. Better get it
    using following command.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>maven plugin:download -DgroupId=maven-itest-plugin
        -DartifactId=maven-itest-plugin -Dversion=1.0
        -Dmaven.repo.remote=http://ws.zones.apache.org/~dims/maven</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><a name="d2"></a><strong>I have problems building with maven
    1.1</strong> ....<br>
    </p>
    <p>It seems that maven 1.1 doesn't come bundled with the required
    artifact plugin. Run following to get it updated<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>maven plugin:download -DgroupId=maven
        -DartifactId=maven-artifact-plugin -Dversion=1.6</li>
      <p>You may need to update the itest plugin too, using the above command
      in #1.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><a name="d3"></a><strong>What versions of maven are supported?
    </strong> ....<br>
    </p>
    <p>Versions 1.0.2 and 1.1 are supported. Maven2 as of yet is not supported. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="d4"></a><strong>What are the frequently used maven
    commands?</strong></li>

<h2>Services</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a name="e1"></a><strong>How do I have multiple services in one service
    archive?</strong></li>

  <p>It's just a matter of writing a services.xml file to configure the
  service or services in an archive file. The corresponding services.xml
  SHOULD look like below:</p>
  <pre>   &lt;serviceGroup&gt;
   &lt;service <strong>name="myService1"</strong>&gt;
   ...........................
   &lt;/service&gt;

   &lt;service <strong>name="myService2"</strong>&gt;
   ...........................
   &lt;/service&gt;
   &lt;serviceGroup&gt;</pre>

  <p>NOTE : The name attribute is a compulsory attribute which will become
  the name of the services. But if you want to have one service in the
  archive file then there are two options, either have one service inside
  serviceGroup tag or have only one service tag as shown below in your
  services.xml, in which case, name of the service will be the name of the
  archive file and you can not override that.</p>
  <pre>   &lt;service&gt;
   ...............
   &lt;service&gt;</pre>
</ol>

<h2>Web Archive / Server side</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a name="f1"></a><strong>I see an internal server error page when I try
    to view the WSDL file.</strong><br>

    <p>This happens specifically with tomcat 4.x and 5.0 in a JDK 1.5
    environment. The reason is that the system picks up a wrong transformer
    factory class. This can be solved simply by putting the xalan-2.7.0.jar
    (found <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/java-repository/xalan/jars/"
    target="_blank">here</a>) into the axis2/WEB-INF/lib directory</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>WSDL and Code Generation</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a name="g1"></a><strong>Given a WSDL 2.0 document with HTTP Binding to
    WSDL2Java, should it not be able to generate a client stub similar to
    what happens given a WSDL 1.1 document with SOAP Binding?</strong></li>

  <p>WSDL 2.0 is not supported yet. We do not have a working WSDL 2.0
  reader.</p>

  <p>However the codegen engine works off WOM (not WSDL4J) hence if the WSDL
  2.0 reader is done, we are all set to generate code for it.</p>

  <p>And yes, it is perfectly possible for the codegen to generate code for
  the HTTP binding. We already have the client API support for making the
  REST calls and it should be a matter of putting in a correct template.</p>
