<h2>Download Axis2</h2>

<p>Axis2 is distributed in several convenient distribution packages and can
    be installed either as a standalone server or as part of a J2EE compliant
    servlet container. Axis2 is distributed under the Apache License, version
    2.0. This Installation Guide will mainly focus on running Apache Axis2 using
    the Standard Binary Distribution.</p>

<h2>Installation Using Standard Binary Distribution</h2>
<a name="standalone1"></a>
<h3>1. Download and Install the Apache Axis2 Binary Distribution</h3>
<p> Download and install a Java Development Kit (JDK) release (version 1.4 or later) from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/"
> here .</a> Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.Set an environment 
variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.</p>

<p>Download and unpack the <a
        href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download/1_1/download.cgi">Axis2 Standard Binary Distribution</a>
        into a convenient location so that the distribution resides in its own directory. Set an 
        environment variables AXIS2_HOME to the pathname of the extracted directory of Axis2 (Eg: /opt/axis2-1.1).
</p>
<a name="standalone2"></a>
<h3>2. Starting up Axis2 Standalone Server</h3>

<p> Standalone Axis2 server can be started by executing the following commands: <br/>
      $AXIS2_HOME\bin\axis2server.bat (Windows) <br/>
      $AXIS2_HOME/bin/axis2server.sh  (Unix)
 <p>After startup, the default web services included with Axis2 will be
available by visiting http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/</p>

<a name="standalone3"></a>
<h3>3. Building the Axis2 Web Application (axis2.war) Using Standard Binary Distribution</h3>
<p> Download and install Apache Ant (version 1.6.5 or later) from <a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi"
> here .</a> Install the Apache Ant according to the instructions included with the Ant release.</p>

<p>Locate the ant build file (build.xml) inside the webapp directory which resides in your Axis2 home
 directory (i.e:- $AXIS_HOME/webapp)". Run the Ant build by executing "ant create.war" inside the $AXIS2_HOME/webapps folder. 
You can find the generated axis2.war inside the $AXIS2_HOME/dist directory. All the services and modules that are present in the
AXIS2_HOME/repository will be packed in to the created axis2.war together with the Axis2 configuration found
at $AXIS2_HOME/conf/axis2.xml.</p>
<p> You can read the <a href="#servlet_container">installing Axis2 in a servlet container</a> to figure 
out how to deploy the Axis2 web application in a servlet container. </p>

<a name="standalone4"></a>
<h3>4. Getting Familiar with the Axis2 Convenient Scripts</h3>
<p>It is advised to add the $AXIS2_HOME/bin to the PATH, so that you'll be able to run the following scripts from any where.</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><b>Script Name</b></td>
	<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>axis2.{bat|sh}</td>
	<td>You can use this script to run web service clients written using Axis2.
	This script calls the "java" command after adding the classpath for Axis2 dependent libraries (*.jar files present in your AXIS2_HOME/lib), 
	setting the Axis2 repository location (AXIS2_HOME/repository) and setting the Axis2 configuration file location(AXIS2_HOME/conf/axis2.xml) for you. With this you can be relieved from setting all the above Axis2 specific parameters.<br/>
	
	<p><em>Usage : axis2.{sh.bat}  [-options] class [args...]</em></p>	    
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>axis2server.{sh|bat}</td>
	<td>This script will start an standalone Axis2 server using the AXIS2_HOME/repository as the
	 Axis2 repository and the AXIS2_HOME/conf/axis2.xml as the Axis2 configuration file.  This will start all the transport listeners listed in the AXIS2_HOME/conf/axis2.xml.
	<p>As an example, if you want to deploy a service using standalone Axis2 server,then copy your 
	service archive to the AXIS2_HOME/repository/services directory. After that go to the "Transport Ins" section of the AXIS2_HOME/conf/axis2.xml and configure the transport receivers (simpleHttpServer in port 8080 is listed by default). Then invoke this script.</p> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>wsdl2java.{bat|sh}</td>
	<td>This script generates java code according to a given WSDL file to handle Web service invocations 
	(Client side Stubs). This script also has the ability to generate service skeletons according to the given WSDL.<br/>
	<p><em>Usage:  WSDL2Java.{sh|bat} [OPTION]... -uri &lt;Location of WSDL> </em></p>
	<p>Eg:  WSDL2Java.sh -uri ../wsdl/Axis2Sample.wsdl </p>
	<p>A more detailed reference about this script can be found <a href="reference.html">here</a></p></td>	
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>java2wsdl.{bat|sh} </td>
	<td>This script generates the appropriate WSDL file for a given java class.<br/>
	<em><p>Usage:  Java2WSDL.{sh|bat} [OPTION]... -cn &lt;fully qualified class name> </em></p>
	<p>Eg:  Java2WSDL.sh -cn ../samples/test/searchTool.Search</p>

<h2>Installing Axis2 in a Servlet Container</h2>
<p>Which ever the distribution, installing Axis2 in a J2EE compliant servlet
    container is as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Build the Axis2 WAR
        file using the Axis2 Standard Binary Distribution. (Alternatively you can
         <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download/1_1/download.cgi">download</a> the axis2.war
        or you can build axis2.war using the <a href="#war">Source
        Distribution</a>.</li>
    <li>Drop the war in the webapps folder of the servlet container. Most
        servlet containers will automatically install war. (some servlet
        containers may require a restart in order to capture the new web
        application. Refer your servlet container documentation for more
        information about this.)</li>
    <li>Once the WAR is successfully installed, test it by pointing the web
        browser to the <strong>http://&lt;host :port&gt;/axis2. </strong>It
        should produce the following page which is the <strong>Axis2 Web
        Application Home Page</strong>.</li>

    <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image006.jpg"
                                   alt=""></strong></p>
    <li>Use the link "Validate" to ensure that everything is fine and smooth.
        If the validation fails then the war has failed to install properly or
        some essential jars are missing. At such a situation the documentation of
        the particular servlet container should be consulted to find the problem.
        The following page is a successful validation. Note the statement core
        Axis2 libraries are present.</li>
</ol>

<p align="center"><img src="images/happyaxis.jpg"></p>
<a name="upload"></a>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For any Application server specific installation
    information please refer <a href="app_server.html">Application Server
    Specific Configuration Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Uploading Services</h2>
<ol>
    <p>The Axis2 Web application also provides an interface to upload services.
        Once a service is created according to the service specification as
        described in <a name="userguide.html" target="_blank">User's Guide that jar
        file can be uploaded using the upload page.</a></p>

    <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image010.jpg"
                                   alt=""></strong></p>

    <p>The uploaded jar files will be stored in the default service directory.
        For Axis2 this will be the &lt;webapps&gt;/axis2/WEB-INF/services
        directory. Once a service is uploaded it will be installed instantly.</p>
    <a name="hot_deployment"></a>
    <p>Since Axis2 supports <strong>hot deployment</strong> one can drop the
        service jar directly through the file system to the above mentioned
        services directory. It will also cause the service to be automatically
        installed without the container being restarted.</p>

    <p>Use the 'Services' link on the Web Application home page to check the
        successful installation of a service. The services and the operations of
        successfully installed services will be displayed in the available services
        page.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="images/clip_image012.jpg" alt=""></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>If the service has deployment time errors it will list those services as
        faulty services. If you click on the link you can see the deployment fault
        error message(s).</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="images/faultservice.jpg" alt=""></p>

    <p>Deployment time error message</p>

    <p align="center"><strong><img src="images/faultmsg.jpg"
                                   alt=""></strong></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>Axis2 Administration is all about configuring Axis2 at the run time and
        the configuration will be transient. More descriptions are available in <a
            href="webadminguide.html" target="_blank">Axis2 Web Administration
        Guide</a></p>

<h2>Axis2 Source Distribution</h2>
<a name="_Toc96698083"></a>
Using the Source Distribution both binary files (which is downloadable as the </a><a href="#std-bin">Standard Binary
Distribution</a>) and axis2.war file (which is downloadable as the <a href="#war1">WAR distribution</a>) can be built using maven commands.

<p>Required jar files do not come with the distribution and they will also
    have to be built by running the maven command. Before we go any further it is
    necessary to install <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/"
                            target="_blank">Maven</aandsettheEnvironment.Thenextsectionwillguideyouhowtodojustthat.>
</a></p>
<a name="env-src"></a>
<h3>Setting Up the Environment and Tools</h3>
<a name="maven"></a>

<h4>Maven</h4>

<p>The Axis2 build is based on <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/"
                                  target="_blank">Maven </a>. Hence the only prerequisite to build
    Axis2 from
    source distribution is to have Maven installed. Extensive instruction guides
    are available at the Maven site. This guide however contains the easiest path
    for quick environment setting. Advanced users who wish to know more about
    Maven can visit <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/start/index.html"
                       target="_blank">here </a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>MS Windows</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Download and run the Windows installer package for Maven.</li>
    <li>Set the 'Environment Variables' ( create system variable MAVEN_HOME and
        edit path. eg: "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\maven-1.0.2";
        path %MAVEN_HOME%\bin)</li>
    <li>Make sure that system variable JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your
        JDK, eg. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_02</li>
    <li>Run maven --version to verify that it is correctly installed.</li>
</ol>

<p align="center"><img alt="clip_image002 (15K)"
                       src="images/clip_image002.jpg" height="211" width="477"></p>
<ul>
    <li>Unix based OS (Linux etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>The tar ball or the zip archive is the best option. Once the archive is
    downloaded expand it to a directory of choice and set the environment
    variable MAVEN_HOME and add MAVEN_HOME/bin to the path as well. More
    instructions for installing Maven in Unix based operating systems can be
    found <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation"
             target="_blank">here </a>.</p>

<p>Once maven is properly installed you can start building Axis2.</p>

<p><a href="../faq.html#d4">Maven commands that are frequently used</a> in
    Axis2 are listed on the <a href="../faq.html">FAQs</a> page.</p>
<a name="_Toc96698085"></a>

<h3>Building Binaries and WAR File Using the Source Distribution</h3>

<p>The Source Distribution is available as a zipped archive. All the
    necessary build scripts are included with the source distribution. Once the
    source archive is expanded into a directory of choice, moving to the
    particular directory and running <code>maven</code> command will build the
    Axis2 jar file.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="clip_image004 (43K)" src="images/maven.jpg"><br
        clear="all">
</p>

<p>Once the command completes, the binaries (jar files in this case) can be
    found at a newly created "target" directory.</p>

<p><strong>Note: For the first Maven build (if the maven repository is not
    built first) it will take a while since required jars need to be downloaded.
    However this is a once only process and will not affect any successive
    builds.</strong></p>
<a name="war"></a>

<p><strong></strong>The default maven build will however build only the Axis2
    jar file. To obtain a <strong>WAR (Web Archive)</strong>, <code>maven
    war</code> command should be issued. This will create a complete WAR with the
    name axis2.war inside the target directory.</p>

<p>Once this build step is complete, the binaries are ready to be
    deployed.</p>
