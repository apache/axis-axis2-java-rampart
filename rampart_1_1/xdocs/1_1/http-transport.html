<h2>CommonsHTTPTransportSender</h2>

<p>This is the default transport sender that is used in Server API as well as
Client API. As the name implies it is based on commons-httpclient-3.0.1. In
order to acquire the maximum flexibility, this sender has implemented POST
interface and GET interface. GET and HTTP interfaces are also involved in Axis2 REST support.</p>

<p>Chunking and KeepAlive support is also integrated via the
facilities provided by commons-httpclient along with HTTP 1.1 support.</p>

<p>&lt;transportSender/&gt; element is used to define transport senders in
the Axis2.xml as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;transportSender name="http" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.http.CommonsHTTPTransportSender"&gt;
     &lt;parameter name="PROTOCOL" locked="false"&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;/parameter&gt;
     &lt;parameter name="Transfer-Encoding"&gt;chunked&lt;/parameter&gt;
      &lt;/transportSender&gt;
</pre>

<p>The above code snippet shows the simplest configuration of transport
sender for common use. &lt;parameter/&gt; element introduces the additional parameters that
should be compliant with the sender. HTTP PROTOCOL version sets as HTTP/1.0
or HTTP/1.1. Default version is HTTP/1.1. It should be noted that chunking
support is available only for HTTP/1.1. Thus, even if the user turn on "chunking", if the HTTP version is 1.0, this setting will be ignored by the transport framework. KeepAlive property is default in version 1.1.</p>

<p>Some absolute properties are provided at runtime, such as character encoding style (UTF-8, UTF-16 etc) etc, are provided via MessageContext.</p>

<a name="httpsupport"></a>
<h3>HTTPS support</h3>

It should be noted that CommonsHTTPTransportSender can be used to communicate
over https. <code></code>
<pre>&lt;transportSender name="<b>https</b>" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.http.CommonsHTTPTransportSender"&gt;
     &lt;parameter name="PROTOCOL" locked="false"&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;/parameter&gt;
    &lt;parameter name="Transfer-Encoding"&gt;chunked&lt;/parameter&gt;
 &lt;/transportSender&gt;
</pre>

<p>Please note that https works only when the server does not expect to
authenticate the clients and where the server has the clients' public keys in
its trust store.</p>

<a name="timeout_config"></a>
<h2>Timeout Configuration</h2>

<p>There are two timeout exists in transport level. They are called, Socket
timeout and Connection timeout. This can be configured in deployment time or
in run time. At the time of deployment, user has to add the following lines in
Axis2.xml.</p>

<p>For Socket timeout:</p>
<pre>&lt;parameter name="SO_TIMEOUT" locked="false"&gt;some_int_value&lt;/parameter&gt;</pre>

<p>For Connection timeout:</p>
<pre> &lt;parameter name="CONNECTION_TIMEOUT" locked="false"&gt;some_int_value&lt;/parameter&gt;</pre>
<br>
At runtime it is set as follows in the Stub. <source>
<pre>...
Options options = new Options();
options.setProperty(HTTPConstants.SO_TIMEOUT,new Integer(timeOutInMilliSeconds));
options.setProperty(HTTPConstants.CONNECTION_TIMEOUT,new Integer(timeOutInMilliSeconds));

// or

options.setTimeOutInMilliSeconds(timeOutInMilliSeconds);
...</pre>
</source>

<a name="version_config"></a>
<h2>HTTP Version Configuration</h2>

<p>The default HTTP version is 1.1. There are two methods in which user can
change HTTP version to 1.0</p>
<ol>
  <li>By defining version in Axis2.xml as shown below.</li>
  <pre> &lt;parameter name="PROTOCOL" locked="false"&gt;HTTP/1.0&lt;/parameter&gt;</pre>
  <li>Or user can change version at runtime by doing the following</li>
  <pre>...
options.setProperty(org.apache.axis2.context.MessageContextConstants.HTTP_PROTOCOL_VERSION,org.apache.axis2.transport.http.HTTPConstants.HEADER_PROTOCOL_10);
...</pre>
</ol>

<a name="auth"></a>
<h2>Proxy Authentication</h2>

<p>Commons-http client has the inbuilt ability to support proxy authentication. Axis2 uses deployment time and runtime mechanisms to authenticate proxies.
In deployment time, user has to change the Axis2.xml as follows. This
authentication will be available in http and https.</p>
<pre>&lt;transportSender name="<b>http</b>" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.http.CommonsHTTPTransportSender"&gt;
        &lt;parameter name="PROTOCOL" locked="false"&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;parameter name="PROXY" proxy_host="proxy_host_name" proxy_port="proxy_host_port" locked="true&gt;userName:domain:passWord&lt;/parameter&gt;
&lt;/transportSender&gt;
</pre>

<p>For a particular proxy, if authentication is not available fill
"userName:domain:passWord"as "anonymous:anonymous:anonymous".</p>

<p>At runtime user can override the PROXY settings with an Object of
HttpTransportProperties.ProxyProperties. On the stub initiate an object of
prior and set it to the MessageContext's property bag via
HttpConstants.PROXY. On the stub, it depicts as follows,</p>
<source>
<pre>...
Options options = new Options();
....

HttpTransportProperties.ProxyProperties proxyProperties = new HttpTransportProperties.new ProxyProperties();
proxyProperties.setProxyHostName(....);
proxyProperties.setProxyPort(...);
...
options.setProperty(HttpConstants.PROXY, proxyProperties);
....
</pre>
</source>

<p>The above code would eventually override the deployment proxy
configuration settings.</p>


<a name="preemptive_auth"></a>
<h2>Basic,Digest and NTLM Authentication</h2>

<p>HttpClient supports three different types of http authentication schemes: Basic, Digest and NTLM. Based on the challenge provided by server httpclient automatically selects the authentication scheme the request should be authenticated with. The most secure will be NTLM and least secure will be Basic.</p>

<p>NTLM is the most complex of the authentication protocols supported by
HttpClient. It requires an instance of NTCredentials be available for the
domain name of the server or the default credentials. Note that since NTLM
does not use the notion of realms HttpClient uses the domain name of the
server as the name of the realm. Also note that the username provided to the
NTCredentials should not be prefixed with the domain - ie: "axis2" is correct
whereas "DOMAIN\axis2" is not correct.</p>

<p>There are some significant differences in the way that NTLM works compared
with basic and digest authentication. These differences are generally handled
by HttpClient, however having an understanding of these differences can help
avoid problems when using NTLM authentication.</p>
<ol>
  <li>NTLM authentication works almost exactly the same as any other form of
    authentication in terms of the HttpClient API.  The only difference is
    that you need to supply 'NTCredentials' instead of
    'UsernamePasswordCredentials' (NTCredentials actually extends
    UsernamePasswordCredentials so you can use NTCredentials right throughout
    your application if need be).</li>
  <li>The realm for NTLM authentication is the domain name of the computer
    being connected to, this can be troublesome as servers often have
    multiple domain names that refer to them.  Only the domain name that
    HttpClient connects to (as specified by the HostConfiguration) is used to
    look up the credentials. It is generally advised that while initially
    testing NTLM authentication, you pass the realm in as null which is used
    as the default.</li>
  <li>NTLM authenticates a connection and not a request, so you need to
    authenticate every time a new connection is made and keeping the
    connection open during authentication is vital.  Due to this, NTLM cannot
    be used to authenticate with both a proxy and the server, nor can NTLM be
    used with HTTP 1.0 connections or servers that do not support HTTP
    keep-alives.</li>
</ol>

<p>Axis2 also allows to add a custom Authentication Scheme to httpclient.</p>

<p>The static inner bean Authenticator of HttpTransportProperties will hold the state of the server to be authenticated with. Once filled it has to be set to the Options's property bag with the key as HTTPConstants.AUTHENTICATE. The following code snippet shows the way of configuring the transport framework to use Basic Authentication:</p>
 
 <source>
<pre>
 ...
 Options options = new Options();
 
 HttpTransportProperties.Authenticator
                       auth = new HttpTransportProperties.Authenticator();
            auth.setUsername("username");
            auth.setPassword("password");
            // set if realm or domain is know

 options.setProperty(org.apache.axis2.transport.http.HTTPConstants.BASIC_AUTHENTICATE,auth);
 ...
 </pre></source>
