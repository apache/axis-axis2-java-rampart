<h2>What is Web Services (WS) Policy?</h2>

<p>To consume non trivial web services one must fully understand its xml
contract (WSDL) along with any other additional requirements, capabilities or
preferences which translates to the configuration of the service, and
essentially becomes the policies of the service.</p>

<p>WS Policy framework provides a way to express the policies of a service in
a machine-readable way. Web services infrastructure can be enhanced to
understand and enforce policies at runtime. For instance, a service author
might write a policy requiring digital signature and encryption, while
service consumers could use the policy information to reason out whether they
can adhere to this policy information to use the service or not.</p>

<p>Further more, web service infrastructure could be enhanced to enforce
those requirements without requiring the service author to write even single
line of code.</p>

<h2>Client Side WS-Policy Support</h2>

<p>This release <strong>fully supports WS Policy at client-side</strong>. It
means that when you codegen a stub against a WSLD which contains policies,
the stub will contain the capability to engage the required modules with the
appropriate configurations plus it will generate additional methods in stub 
where the user can used set certain properties. For instance, if there is 
a security policy attached to a binding, the generated stub will engage the
security module for that service with the appropriate security
configurations with some addtional methods that the user can used set properties 
in the generated stub.</p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>

<h4>Phase 1: At PolicyEvaluator</h4>

<p>Codegen engine runs few of its registered extensions before it generates
the stub. When PolicyEvalutor (which is a registered Codegen extension) is
initialized, it populates a registry of QNames of supported policy assertions to
PolicyExtensions.</p>

<p>For instance, module Foo might have a mapping of assertion
{http://test.com/foo, foo} which means any assertion that has this name will be 
processed by this module. Foo module might implement the ModulePolicyExtension 
interface through which PolicyExtension object can be obtained.</p>

<p>A <strong>PolicyExtension</strong> is the access point for a module to add
any additional methods to the stub. For instance Reliable Messaging module can add
startSequence() and endSequence() methods to the stub, that the user must call to
start and end an RM sequence.</p>

<p>Then at the engagement of PolicyEvaluator, effective policy of each messages 
of every operation is calculated based on policy information declared in the WSDL
document. Here we assume that effective policy of an operation contains a
single alternative (<strong>Multiple policy alternatives are not
supported</strong>). Then we split that policy as follows into few other
policies such that, each policy will contain assertions that can be processed
by a single module.</p>
<pre>  &lt;wsp:Policy&gt;         &lt;wsp:Policy&gt;       &lt;wsp:Policy&gt;        
    &lt;a:Foo/&gt;             &lt;a:Foo/&gt;           &lt;b:Foo/&gt;               
    &lt;b:Bar/&gt;      =&gt;    		           &lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;       
    		               &lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;
  &lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;</pre>

<p>Then each policy is given to the appropriate PolicyExtension with an
org.w3c.Element type object to which the module can append any other
elements/attributes it wishes. Those attributes/elements should resolve to
meaningful stub functions via Custom PolicyExtensionTemplate.xsl at latter point
of time.</p>

<p>For instance depending on the policy, Security module can append
&lt;username&gt;, &lt;passwd&gt; elements to the given element as children,
which are later resolved into setUsername(..), setPasswd(..), functions of
the stub. This way a module can include additional methods to the stub which
can be used to get specific propreties from the user. These methods store any
user input in the ServiceClient properties 
(ServiceClient.getOptions().putProperty(...)) which can later be accessed by
the module.</p>

<h4>Phase 2: At AxisServiceBasedMultiLanguageClientEmitter</h4>

<p>Further, policies (based on the WSDL) at appropriate levels
(service level, operation level) are stored as policy strings in the stub. If 
there are few policies at a given level they are merged together and represented
as a single policy in the stub. Few more generic methods are also added to the 
stub which are used to evaluate/process policies at runtime.</p>

<h4>Phase 3: Runtime</h4>

<p>When a new stub object is created, the policy strings in the stub are
converted into policy objects and are set in the AxisDescription hierarchy that 
is used in the stub. In other words, any policy information available in the 
WSDL will be preserved in the AxisService object that is used in the stub.</p>

<p>Then based on its policy each AxisDescription is engaged to a set of
modules. Modules can do a prior calculation of configurations if needed at the
engagement.</p>

<p>When the stub method is invoked, those modules which are engaged to that
AxisDescription, access the policy for that operation via AxisDescription object.
It can get other information needed from the MessageContext which get stored by 
stub methods which the module has added to the stub earlier via 
ModulePolicyExtension implementation. The modules are required to loads their 
configurations according to the effective policy which is set at AxisDescription
and properties they get via MessageContext.</p>

<h2>Server Side WS-Policy Support</h2>

<p>In this current release Axis2 framework uses WS-Commons/Neethi framework
to manipulate policy documents. All its description builders store any policy
information included in description documents (services.xml, axis2.xml, ..
etc) in the appropriate description classes. This information is available at
both deployment and run time via these description classes.</p>

<p>When generating WSDL dynamically for each service, policy information in
the description classes is included. For instance, if you declare a policy in
axis2.xml then that policy is reflected in service elements of WSDL of every
service. If a policy is declared in a services.xml, it is shown in the
service element of WSDL for that particular service.</p>

<p>Further when a service is deployed, an arbitary policy alternative is 
selected and set for each AxisOperation and AxisMessages of the AxisService. If 
the selected Policy alternative can not be supported by any modules that are 
capable of processing the selective alternative, then the service is considered 
as a faulty service. Else set of modules is engaged at appropriate levels to 
support the requirments and capabilities that are defined in the Policies 
that are associated with the AxisDescription.</p>

<p>It is evident that there is some work left to make axis2 a fully fledged 
ws-policy supported web service infrastructure. But it is encouraging to note 
that we've taken the first steps towards this goal. We appreciate any suggestions,
patches etc you send us in this regard. Keep on contributing...!</p>
