WS-Trust - RST - Resquest Security Token Service - Issuing a SAML token - issuing a token

When using this sample with the TCPMon to monitor the soap messages, you have to use the 
correct URL in the client code before build the sample 05.

This sample demonstrates WS-Trust RST (Request Security Token) for issuing SAML tokens.

Note: This sample now uses OpenSAML 4.3.2 which is included with the current Rampart distribution.
The historical reference to OpenSAML 1.1.406 from WSO2's Maven repository is no longer needed
as the OpenSAML library has been significantly updated and the old bug has been resolved.

For current OpenSAML documentation, please refer to:
